# Highlighters
Highlighters is our entry in the action-puzzle genre, and is particularly inspired by games from the 90s (Tetris Attack, Puzzle Fighter). They're visually super stylish, easy to pick up, and a skilled player can take advantage of its design and be rewarded for it.

## Game Rules
The game is made up of two pieces: charms and bombs

To perform a match, line up 4 or more like-coloured pieces adjacent to each other; at least one of them must be a bomb
